# Personal_Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio, meticulously crafted using VS Code. Here, I've added several enhancements to ensure a polished experience. Users can seamlessly switch between light and dark modes for optimal viewing comfort. In the project section, interactive modal windows offer detailed insights when clicking on project images. Additionally, stringent form validation ensures all fields must be completed before submission, maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, the portfolio is responsive across various devices, providing a seamless browsing experience on tablets and smartphones. For your convenience, the portfolio is hosted on Netlify, accessible through this link: https://elegant-kitsune-d4a4c1.netlify.app/
